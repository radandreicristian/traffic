# Traffic Forecasting Pipeline

This repository includes:
* An end-to-end pipeline for training traffic forecasting models on PeMS-Bay and METR-LA.
* Some traffic models that use graph diffusion PDEs for forecasting (after some experiments, we concluded that they are very inefficient :( ).
* Some traffic models that use (sub-quadratic) spatial attention for forecasting, which are adapted from the literature.

This repository is a work in progress.
